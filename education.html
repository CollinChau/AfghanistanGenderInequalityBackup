        <h2>What’s Happening?</h2>
        <p>Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, girls have been banned from attending secondary school and university. This restriction affects millions of young women across the country and is enforced nationwide, especially in rural areas.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>According to Human Rights Watch, banning girls from education could cost Afghanistan billions of dollars in future lost economic productivity. A less educated workforce means a weaker economy and a society unable to fully develop.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Real Stories</h2>
        <p>Despite the bans, many girls are still trying to learn in secret. NPR reports that some women are attending hidden classrooms and online sessions to continue their education. This shows their determination and also how dangerous and unequal the situation is.</p>

        <h2>How This Connects to Human Geography (Unit 5)</h2>
        <p>Unit 5 explores development and human rights. Afghanistan's Gender Inequality Index (GII) has worsened due to policies against girls’ education. Education is one of the biggest indicators of development, and limiting it keeps a country in the “periphery” of the world system model.</p>
