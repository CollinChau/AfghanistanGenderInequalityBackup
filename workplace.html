            <h2>Workplace Restrictions & Everyday Life</h2>
            <p>Learn how Afghan women have been excluded from public life and the economy under Taliban rule. Women are banned from most jobs including education, government, and NGOs and face daily restrictions that prevent them from traveling alone or entering many public spaces.</p>
            <div class="image-caption">Since 2021, many Afghan women have been confined to their homes, banned from most professions and stopped from participating in public life.</div>

        <h2>What Jobs Are Banned?</h2>
        <p>The Taliban have stopped women from participating in most professions. Women can no longer work in government jobs, education, or NGOs. Only a few roles like healthcare or domestic work are still open to them and even these are heavily monitored or limited by gender segregation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Daily Life Under Restrictions</h2>
        <p>Women are not allowed to leave their homes without a male guardian (mahram). They cannot travel long distances alone, and in many cities, public spaces are segregated or off-limits entirely to women. These restrictions have erased women from public view.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Economic Consequences</h2>
        <p>The UNDP reports that preventing women from working could cost Afghanistan up to 5% of its GDP annually. The country already faces economic collapse, and these policies make recovery nearly impossible. Families lose income, and the economy shrinks due to wasted potential.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Connection to Human Geography (Unit 7)</h2>
        <p>This issue relates to urbanization, labor force participation, and global development models. When half a population is excluded from jobs, cities lose productivity, migration slows, and inequality deepens. It also increases Afghanistanâ€™s dependency ratio and economic vulnerability.</p>
